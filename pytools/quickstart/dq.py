"""
dq (data quality) allows you to compare two big csv files (> 100 Mo).
A detailed result of the comparison is output.

In order for the run_dq function to work correctly, the input files must both
have a pivot column (ie. containing keys/IDs) and be free of 'key duplicates'
meaning having different lines with the same ID. The index of the pivot column
is an input parameter (gl.PIVOT_IDX = 0)

In this script, two files used for testing purposes are compared.
Result interpretation:
COMPARE_RES = in_11: the key is present in the file in_11 and not in the file in_12
COMPARE_RES = in_12: the key is present in the file in_12 and not in the file in_11
COMPARE_RES = in_11|in_12: the key is present in both files but lines differ.

In the last case, the differences are outlined by writing the first and second
files' values separated by '|' for each field that differs. For example 'O|N' in
the field 'ETAT' means that the first file (in_11) has a 'O' and the second file
(in_12) has a 'N'.

For more information, see the README.md file.
