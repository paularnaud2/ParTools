# PyTools

This package contains a bunch of Python tools I have developped and used as a Support / Test Engenieer.
You can mainly use them for:

- Performing multithread SQL queries on an Oracle DB (sql)
- Performing multithread SQL queries on a given perimeter on an Oracle DB (rl)
- Comparing and sorting potentially big files (dq)
- Reading and searching potentially big files (toolBF)
- Parsing potentially big XML files (toolParseXML)
- Searching and removing duplicates (toolDup)
- Filtering potentially big file with flexible conditions (toolFilter)
- Splitting potentially big files (toolSplit)
- Sending mails (mail)

## Quickstart

Dowload code, extract zip and run `pip install -e .` at the root.

You'll find examples of use and descriptions of the different available packages and functions in the _quickstart_ folder.
If you want to use the cx_Oracle dependant packages (sql and rl), you'll need an [Oracle instant client](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html) whose directory you can set in the _conf.py_ file.

## The common package

The pytools package includes a _common_ sub package which provides generic functions used by other sub packages. As you may want to use some of them for your own code, I recommend you to check out the list of those functions in _pytools/common/\_\_init\_\_.py_. Here are a few examples:

- `save_list`: saves a list into a text file
- `load_txt`: loads a text file into a string or a list
- `get_file_list`: returns the list of the files in a folder
- `like`: behaves as the LIKE of Oracle SQL (you can match strings with wildcard character '\*')
- `big_number`: converts a potentially big number into a lisible string. For example 10000000 becomes '10 000 000'
- `get_duration_string`: outputs a string representing the time elapsed since the input start_time. For example '3 minutes and 20 seconds'.

### Logging with the common package

If you want the `log` function to actually fill a log file, you have to use `init_log()` before using it, otherwise it will just print out the log info in the console.

You can specify a format for the log time stamp which by default is ``format='%H:%M:%S -'``

The `step_log` function allows you to log some information only if the input ``counter`` is a multiple of the input ``step`` (thus, it is most likely used in for or while loops). `step_log` can be usefull to track the progress of long processes such as reading or writing milions of lines in a file. The ``what`` input expects a description of what is being counted. It's default value is  ``what='lines written'``. In order to correctly measure the time displayed in each log line, the ``step_log`` function has to be initialised using the ``init_sl_time`` function. So for example if you input ``step=500`` and don't input any ``what`` value, you should get something like this:

    19:45:04 - 500 lines written in 3 ms. 500 lines written in total.
    19:45:04 - 500 lines written in 3 ms. 1 000 lines written in total.
    19:45:04 - 500 lines written in 3 ms. 1 500 lines written in total.

### The PT folder

When it is first used, the _common_ package gets initialised by creating a 'PT folder' in the directory defined in the conf.py file (default: FILES_DIR='PT'). This folder is intended to contain the log files and the temporary files generated by the different sub packages. It also has _in_ and _out_ directories used by the test package (and of course that you can also use for your own scripts using pytools).

### The conf.py file

The pytools/conf.py file contains the main user settings for the PyTools package such as the path to the Oracle instant client (``ORACLE_CLIENT``). If needed, you can create a PTconf.py file at the root that will be used instead of the native pytools/conf.py file. Similarly you can also created a PTconf_perso.py file at the root that will take over the two previous files decribed. this can be usefull is you work on a shared repository but still want to have your own configurations.

### The global variable files gl.py and main functions inputs

Each sub package has a gl.py file which sets its global variables and constants. Each gl variables can be passed to the main sub package function (eg. sql.download) and if so, overwrites the value defined in the gl.py file. In that respect, constants defined in the gl.py file can be seen as input default values.
