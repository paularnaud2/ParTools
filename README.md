# PyTools

This package contains a bunch of Python tools I have developped and used as a Support / Test Engenieer.
You can mainly use them for:

- Performing multithreaded SQL queries on Oracle DB (sql)
- Performing multithreaded SQL queries on a given perimeter on Oracle DB (reqlist)
- Comparing and sorting potentially big files (dq)
- Reading and searching potentially big files (toolBF)
- Parsing potentially big XML files (toolParseXML)
- Searching and removing duplicates (toolDup)
- Filtering potentially big file with flexible conditions (toolFilter)
- Splitting potentially big files (toolSplit)
- Sending mails (mail)
